                <br>ABSTRACT</h2>
                <p>'Panacea', also known by its prototype designation 'SC-500' is an emergency-use medicial composed of biosculpting nanites capable of rapidly resolving even an extreme number of harmful medical conditons and injuries. It is only used as a last resort as it is very expensive to produce.</p>

                <br>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>Panacea is a medicinal made entirely of biosculpting nanites capable of resolving almost every condition that could possibly affect a sapient. It is activated either on consumption, by remote SYNC activation, or when its outer layer of nanites detects it is being applied against a wound. After activation and assuming the nanites are not given an overriding order, they systematically seek out the most severe conditions afflicting the target, resolving them until all negative conditions are cured or the nanites run out of power.</p>
                <p>The nanites are capable of all biosculpting tasks, including fleshsculpting, genesculpting, and cybersculpting. Additionally, they are equipped with medical scanners, nutrient synthesizers, and neuron stimulators.</p>

                <br>HISTORY</h2>
                <p>Panacea was developed by the Eternalhold corporation on date [5150-9-18] in a bid to create the 'ultimate portable repair medicine'. It was successful, and Panacea has since been the definitive last-ditch effort emergency tool. It has recieved many revisions to keep it on the edge of technology, but the fundamentals have never been changed.</p>
