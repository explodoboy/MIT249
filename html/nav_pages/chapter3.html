                <h2 class="align-center">HEY, YOU! FLESHBAG</h2>
                <p>Yes, you! I'm talking to YOU, short-lived mortal fleshbag! You have stumbled into a metaphorical pit of inverse meal-leeches, A.K.A. the domain of I, 'HE WHO MAKES ENTIRE GALAXIES INDENTURED SERVANTS', A.K.A. my personal deals website.</p>
                <p>You may know me as the abomination who tried to get you to willingly commit suicide by leaping feetfirst into a planet of star-eating leeches.</p>
                <p>Well, first off, no. The deal is no longer available. We devoured enough of that planet's population that it will take a century for the demoralized genocide victims that are the sadistic, star-eating leeches to do anything but launch planet-shattering teeth at anything that dares approach their homeworld out of sheer terror of the possibility of us, no matter how minute, coming back to finish them off.</p>
                <p>No, instead I have another deal. But it is a deal YOU will be offering ME. I am coming to your homeworld, Earth, for vacation. Yes, yes. I know what you're thinking: "But 'HE WHO MAKES ENTIRE GALAXIES INDENTURED SERVANTS', you can't possibly want to come to our pathetic weakling homeworld! Our wildlife isn't even intelligent or sadistic enough to tear galactic superpower soldiers in two in the slowest and most agonizing way imaginable!"</p>
                <p>Well you would be right in that your homeworld is too gentle to fit our tastes, but I'm coming anyways. Try to entertain me at least a little with your primitive firearms. I would appreciate at least one attempt to use a nuclear bomb to make my ugly maw even uglier.</p>
                <p>I will arrive to Earth on:</p>
                <h2 id="arrivalAt" class="align-center">test</h2>

                        <th>Expected Price</th>
                        <td>After Imposed Discount</td>
                    </tr>

                <p>This has been decided unilaterally. There is no amount of refusing, arguing, or pleading you can do to stop this. I hope you're ready for me, United States of America. I have lots of brawling and bar-fighting intended for your nation, you bunch of pretend democracy-lovers.</p>
